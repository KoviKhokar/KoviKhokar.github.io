        <li> <strong>Snake Island, Brazil</strong>  </li>

        <li> <strong>Dana Kill Desert, Ethopia</strong>  </li>
        <h4 id="c">You will find a lot of salty poison pools that have a great percent of carbon dioxide in them becaaus the carbon dioxide is heavier than normal air it sinks to the ground so when small creatures like birds breathe they suffocate !! Well that is similar to humans too !!!</h4>
